                        <div class="half-width">
                            <p>I live in Gainesville, Florida with my husband, daughters, and pets. My journey into
                                 tech started with a degree in science education, and I've spent several years in higher education. I became inspired to start coding by seeing a few of my 
                                friends move into tech roles. I played around with a couple free coding camps online, and I was hooked by the instant-gratification of seeing my code 
                            come to life on a webpage.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="half-width">
                            <p>That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. 
                                When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versatility 
                                I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, 
                                where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.</p>

                        <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
                        <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic 
                            HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, 
                            easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

                       <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
                       <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. 
                        I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>

                        <h3>Ease Converting Designs into Code</h3>
                        <p>You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly & accurately 
                            convert it into a webpage that is pixel-perfect match.</p>
